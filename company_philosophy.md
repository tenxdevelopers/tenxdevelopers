# Product Philosophy

Some of these learnings from Steve Jobs really inspired me. My company will strictly adhere to these ideas as first principles. When in doubt, i expect the team to always fallback on these principles.

### Stand for something

- Empathy : Understanding People

- Focus : Do few things extremely well

- Impute : Great Marketing

### A Great product is Great Marketing

- A great product markets itself, each time a product is released excellence is expected

### Sell an Idea or Status

- Steve Jobs is an innovator who moved the world forward. This was the same idea or status that Apple sold. People who use Apple products can move the world forward

- Don't sell the product or the benefits of it, sell what the product does for it's consumers (How does Apple product make your life a little better.)

### Tell Stories

- The idea/status was sold through telling stories

- The "Think Different" campaign focused on the people who thought different and changed the world. If you bought an Apple product, you thought different i.e. you can change the world.

- Inspire customers through story telling, tell them to dream bigger and how the product can help you achieve that dream.

### Create Brand Advocates

- By inspiring people to change the world and think differently, Jobs was able to successfully translate consumers into fans. They felt like they are part of a movement, something bigger than themselves. This resulted in a cult like following.

- Cults will have a Us vs Them mentality. You could see this happening with FB early days as well.
    - Mac vs PC
    - Iphone vs Android 

- These cults will lead to fans doing marketing for you, because cults never want to lose.

### Secrets create suspense

- Cult like fans means they always wanted to know what Apple was upto. Before releases they would drop a hint, then a rumor and a conflicting rumor and the buzz would get going.

- This would create an experience to the fans involved. It was something personal to them. Apple prioritizes experiences over campaigns.
